# NODE.JS ultra-fast RESTful api

This project is a very basic boilerplate for start developing a micro blog backend service to cast easy-as-hell RESTful Apis, before start playing, you must:

  - Clone this project
  - Run npm i inside project's root folder
  - Then run npm start.
  - Call your mom and show her what you just did!!!

> Your App will be available at localhost:8080, from that moment on you
> may: Increment this projects, add your own models, connect to
> your own server and even create new routes. Or, you can only change the authors name inside package.json and pretend you came up with this all by your self. (that worked for me).
